Assignments
==========

1. Run both client and server on same machine.

2. Research on client and server model.
    a. motivation behind client server model
    b. characteristics of client server model
        i. terminology and concept
    c. Differentiate and give examples of 
        i. connection-less and connection oriented servers
        ii. stateless and stateful servers
    d. Examples of
        i. standard client software
        ii. standard server software
        iii. non standard software from assignment 1, explain purpose of software.
    e. Design an application as a client server program. A banking application that provides
        the following services:
        i. opening account
        ii. closing account
        iii. withdrawal
        iv. deposit
        v. balance and statement

        The design can be basic, iterative server.

3. Research on concurrent processing in  client server model.
    a. motivation behind concurrent processing.
    b. How concurrent processing is achieved in networks (Hardware/Operating system level)
    c. concurrent processing
        i terminology and concepts
        ii. concurrent process creation in unix (with possible change in code)
        iii. concurrent process execution.
    d. advantages of concurrent processing in client, server model.
    e. name the important algorithms used in client design.
        For each algorithm describe
        i. why it is important
        ii. when/where it would typically be used
        iii. any predefined data structures that it may require to use.

4. Rewrite the example program to allow the client to communicate with the server using UDP.
    a. Rewrite selected application to use UDP.
    b. highlight the changes you have made.
    c. document the code to explain
        i. creating sockets
        ii. end point addresses (IP + Port)
        ii client communicating with server, sending data
        iv. server sending data to client.
        v. receiving a response, client and server.
        vi. closing the sockets, client and server
    d. study the example programs in chapter seven.

5. describe the conceptual server algorithm.
    a. distinguish between the following
        i. concurrent vs iterative servers
        ii. connection oriented vs connection-less
    b. research on the following servers and when to use them:
        i. iterative connection-less
        ii. iterative connection oriented
        iii. concurrent connection oriented
        iv. concurrent connection-less oriented
    c. study the examples in chapters 9-12
    d. Rewrite the selected application to use the following types of servers.
        i. concurrent connection oriented
        ii. concurrent connection-less oriented
        highlight how you have implemented concurrency
